## How to Start Development

Follow these steps to get up and running with the project.

### Prerequisites

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Unity Editor*: [Download Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download) and install the correct Unity version:
- üîß *Version:* ‚Å†‚ÄØUnity 6000.0.37f1‚ÄØ‚Å†
  ‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†(Optional) *Rider* or any C# IDE with Unity support


###  Clone the Repository

‚Å†‚ÄØbash
git clone https://github.com/PM4-FS25-FortressForge/PM4-FS25-FortressForge.git
‚ÄØ‚Å†

### Open with Unity

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Open Unity Hub
- Navigate to Add -> Add project from disk
- Navigate to your clones Repository
- *Important:* Make sure to select the ‚Å†‚ÄØFortressForge/‚ÄØ‚Å† subfolder (not the root of the repository)
    - This is the actual Unity project folder

Now you can start your installation with Unity.

## Testing & Quality Metrics

### Static Code Analysis
We use Sonarqube to perform static code analysis. It checks for code quality and style issues. Reports are available in [location or CI logs, or tool dashboard].

### Code Coverage
Test coverage is currently at **54%**, as shown below:

![Code Coverage Report](CodeCoverage.png)

This coverage report shows which parts of the codebase are covered by automated tests. 
Next step would be to continuously improve this metric to ensure better test reliability and robustness.


#### Note: Some portions of the codebase are automatically generated or stem from Unity‚Äôs internal systems. These are not manually modified or tested, which may lower the overall coverage percentage.

## Development

### Scrum Rules and Descriptions

What is Scrum?

* Scrum is an agile framework that helps teams solve complex problems by focusing on continuous improvement, based on the principles of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

### Task Structure

* **User Story**: A user story is a short description of a feature written from the user's perspective. It describes what the user can do and why.

  * **Acceptance Criteria**: The acceptance criteria are the conditions that must be met for the user story to be considered complete.
* **Task**: A task is a piece of work that needs to be done to complete the user story.

A user story is broken down into tasks by the developer(s). Each task is worked on by a single developer and is merged into the `main` branch once completed (even if the user story as a whole is not yet finished).

### Sprint

* **Duration**: 2 weeks
* **Sprint Planning**: At the beginning of the sprint, a Sprint Planning meeting is held where the user stories to be worked on during the sprint are selected.
* **Daily Standup**: Several times a week, a standup meeting is held where each developer shares what they worked on recently, what they will work on today, and if there are any blockers.
* **Sprint Review**: At the end of the sprint, a Sprint Review meeting is held to present the completed user stories.
* **Sprint Retrospective**: At the end of the sprint, a Sprint Retrospective meeting is held where the team discusses what went well, what didn‚Äôt go well, and what can be improved.
