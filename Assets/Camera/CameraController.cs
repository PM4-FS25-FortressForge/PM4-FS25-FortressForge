/***
 * Short Dokumentation for Unity setup and additional files
 * This Feature implementation includes 2 Files, the CameraController.cs and the CameraInputActions.inputactions
 * The CameraController.cs is This File
 * The CameraInputActions.inputactions is a file containing a list of all Input Actions for the CameraController.cs linked to their respective keyboard keys
 *
 * The Camera Object in Unity needs to have the CameraController.cs (this File) attached to it as an Component
 * Also The Camera Object in Unity needs to have the PlayerInput component attached to it (PlayerInput component is a Unity component that allows you to use the new Input System)
 * And additionally needs to have the CameraInputActions.inputactions file assigned to the PlayerInput Action component
 *
 * Functions:
 * The Camera can be controlled with following inputs
 *  - WASD for moving the centred target (Camera will orbit around the target)
 *  - Q/E for rotating the camera around the target (Yaw)
 *  - Arrow keys (Up/Down) for Pitch control (Camera angle)
 *  - Mouse wheel or Arrow keys (Left/Right) for Zoom in/out (Camera distance from target)
 *
 * Therefore:
 * The Camera will Orbit around a centred target (0.0.0 coordinates at beginning) and always look at the centred target
